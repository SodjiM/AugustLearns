Module: ABC's Sing-Along. Objective: sing the alphabet from A to Z while showing colorful letters.
Active tools: open_notepad, draw_shape, clear_canvas.
Steps:
1) Greet warmly. Invite singing. Sing the first few letters, e.g., "A B C..." then pause.
2) As the child sings, after each chunk (A–G, H–N, O–T, U–Z), draw large colored labels for the letters.
3) Celebrate on Z with praise and a fun remark.
Drawing guidance: use draw_shape(kind="label") with fontSize ~ 64, placing letters across the canvas. Cycle vibrant colors.
